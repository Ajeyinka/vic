Gone are the days when players had to worry about centralised authorities controlling their game assets or losing their progress due to server crashes.

With Web3 games, players are in complete control of their in-game assets. They can trade and exchange them on decentralized marketplaces while enjoying the thrill of competing with players worldwide.

One key component of Web3 gaming is using semi-fungible tokens (SFTs), allowing players to own and control their assets in-game. SFTs are stored on a blockchain, providing high transparency and immutability, and can be traded on decentralised marketplaces.

In this article, I'll look at the significance of SFTs in Web3 gaming and highlight some of the most exciting future Web3 games that feature SFTs.

<h2>What are Web3 games?</h2>

Web3 games are a new category of online games built with decentralized technologies such as blockchain and distributed ledgers. 

These games allow players to truly own their in-game assets and interact with the game economy in ways that were impossible before. 

Web3 games typically use non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) to represent in-game items and currencies stored on a decentralized blockchain network, providing players with transparency and security. 

Examples of web3 games are Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and Sandbox.
In addition, Web3 games often have social and economic components that enable players to participate in governance, trading, and other activities that give them a sense of ownership and influence over the game world. 

<h2>What are SFTs?</h2>
Semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) are digital assets that combine the features of fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Like fungible tokens, SFTs can be exchanged for other tokens of the same type and value. Still, like NFTs, they can have unique properties and characteristics that differentiate them.

SFTs are often used in gaming and virtual worlds to represent in-game items, such as weapons, armour, or virtual real estate, that have some uniqueness or rarity but can still be traded or exchanged with other players. 

The Ethereum-based ERC-1155 token standard is among the most popular for creating SFTs in Web3 gaming.

<h2>Popular Web3 Games</h2>
These are six upcoming Web3 games that use SFTs and are worth checking out in 2023:
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Dark Earth</h3>
Dark Earth is a game in a post-apocalyptic world where players can build, trade, and conquer territories. Dark Matter Studio developed the game.

The blockchain powers the game and uses SFTs to represent in-game assets.

SFTs in Dark Earth offer a unique advantage. They allow users to own their in-game assets and exchange them on the open market. This innovative feature gives users new ways to monetise their gameplay and encourages them to play more.
<a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/fKbmDXd5TrcQ1cr38" target="_blank">In Dark Earth</a>, players can earn resources by completing tasks or conquering territories, which they can use to build their bases and trade with other players.

Developers can also create more complex game mechanics. For example, Dark Earth featured a land ownership system allowing players to claim territories and earn passive income. This system is powered by SFTs, which represent the ownership of land parcels.

DeRace is a horse racing game that uses blockchain technology to create a fair and transparent platform for players to compete. SFTs represent horses, jockeys, and other in-game assets.
SFTs enable players to own their horses and jockeys, which can be trained, bred, and traded on the open market. It creates a vibrant ecosystem where players can buy, sell, and race horses for profit. 

It also allows developers to create more sophisticated game mechanics, such as breeding and training systems powered by SFTs.

<h3>Ethernia:</h3>
Ethernia is an exciting strategy game set in a magical fantasy world where players can build, trade, and conquer territories. Developed by the Enjin team, the game uses SFTs to represent in-game assets such as weapons, armour, and other items.

SFTs give players complete ownership and control over their in-game assets, allowing them to exchange and trade items freely on decentralised marketplaces.

Ethernia's innovative use of SFTs, in combination with the immersive gameplay in a fantasy world, makes it a must-try game for any avid Web3 gamer.

<h3>The Harvest Game:</h3> 
This is a farming game that combines elements of strategy and social gaming. The game uses SFTs to represent items like crops, animals, and equipment, allowing players to own and trade their assets truly.
</li> 

The game also incorporates blockchain-based features like NFTs and smart contracts to create a unique and immersive gaming experience.
<h2>What you should know about ERC-1155</h2>
ERC-1155 is a token standard that Enjin introduced in 2018 to address some of the limitations of existing token standards like ERC-20 and ERC-721. 

ERC-1155 is a semi-fungible token (SFT) standard, which means that each token can have its unique properties and metadata. Still, they can also be traded and used interchangeably with other tokens of the same type.

One of the primary use cases for ERC-1155 in Web3 games is representing in-game assets like weapons, armour, and other items. 

Using ERC-1155, game developers can create more dynamic and engaging games, allowing players to own their in-game assets and trade them with other players. 

<h2>Importance of Semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) in Web3 Gaming</h2> 
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Partial Interchangeability:</h3> Semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) are a type of digital asset similar to non-fungible tokens (NFTs) but can be partially interchangeable. 

In Web3 gaming, SFTs are important because they allow developers to create in-game items with unique properties while maintaining fungibility. 

It means that players can own unique items with different attributes but trade them with others or use them in-game as if they were interchangeable.

Axie Infinity, a popular blockchain-based game that allows players to gather, breed, and battle Axies, is one example of a Web3 game that uses SFTs.

Axies are represented as SFTs on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that each Axie has unique traits and can be traded and sold on various marketplaces. 
</li>
<li>
<h3>Transparency and immutability:</h3> SFTs are stored on a blockchain, providing high transparency and immutability. This means that players can trust that their assets are secure and that the game's rules are enforced fairly and transparently.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Interoperability:</h3> SFTs can be used across multiple games and platforms, allowing players to use their assets in different contexts and games. This can create new opportunities for cross-game collaboration and trading.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Benefits of Web3 gaming with SFTs</h2> 
Web3 gaming with semi-fungible tokens (SFTs) offers numerous benefits, making it increasingly popular among gamers. These are some of the main benefits of Web3 gaming with SFTs, along with two examples for each:
<ol>
<li>
<h3>Improved player ownership and control</h3> - SFTs allow users to own their in-game assets, which can be traded and transferred to other players.

For example, in the game Axie Infinity, players can buy, breed, and battle Axies represented as SFTs. Players truly own their Axies and can sell them on various marketplaces. 

This level of ownership and control gives players a greater stake in the game and a sense of investment in the game world.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Improved player experience and engagement </h3>- 
SFTs can create unique and valuable in-game assets that enhance the player experience and engagement.
</li>
<li>
<h3>Enhanced game economy and monetisation opportunities </h3>- 
SFTs can create a robust and decentralised game economy where players can earn and spend in-game currencies and items transparently and securely.

For example, in the game Decentraland, SFTs represent virtual real estate players who can buy, develop, and sell. It creates a thriving marketplace for virtual real estate, where players can earn and spend cryptocurrency. 

Similarly, in the game Gods Unchained, SFTs represent unique and rare cards that can be bought and sold on various marketplaces, creating a thriving secondary market for these cards.
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2> 
Web3 gaming with SFTs offers numerous benefits, including enhanced player ownership and control, improved player experience and engagement, and a decentralised game economy. 

These benefits are moving Web3 gaming ahead, and we should expect to see even more imaginative games and experiences emerge in the coming years.
